<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>It is observed that more than 1.7 million people in France experience some trouble in their vision. 207000 are highly visually impaired, amongst them 65000 are blind. 90% of people older than 65 are visually impaired. These numbers are expeted to double in 2050. An application for detecting, localizing and finally guiding the end user towards an object . The application will eventually run on a smartphone and the way it works will be explained briefly.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">LightHouse</code> is an application designed to offer a unique experience to the visually impaired or blind person and contribute to their well-being. It leverages the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in one of its subfields, namely, deep learning. The application would allow anyone in possession of a smartphone and without the use of oneâ€™s eyesight to know approximately whatâ€™s in front of them, what object to look for and provide instructions on how to find it. The innovation of the algorithm stands not only on the latest object detection and localization algorithm, i.e., YOLO, but more importantly, on the many features (modes) that would assist the visually impaired people in their daily life and inside their home.</p>
